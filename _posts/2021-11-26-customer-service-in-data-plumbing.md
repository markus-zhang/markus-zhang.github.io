## On customer service in data plumbing

Technical people don't always enjoy doing customer service. Sometime we prefer to use experience and imagination to fill in the blank and close tickets as soon as possible.

#### Customers are (almost) always right
I find it pointless to argue with requirements. There is a saying that you should always understand customer's requirements before making any move, which I fully agree. However, it's one thing to understand customer's needs, and another to try to persuade them to drop the requirements because "I have been here for 8 years so I know it's not useful", or "This doesn't make sense". As a real world plumber, we should accept any requirement as long as it's not too outrageous. The proper process, IMHO, is to accept as many requirements as possible, weed out the impossibles, estimate the time and then ask your customers to provide priorities.

#### Customers are not necessarily always right
Now we are talking about implementations. My thumb of rule is that customers should NOT tell us how to do the job.
